Tour of the Tract and Simplified Single Cell Shape Model,Highlights the features of the abstracted tract and single cell outgrowth model  ,,,,,,,,,,,Anthony Santella Bao lab,27-Dec,http://scene.wormguides.org/wormguides/testurlscript?/set/saavl-n$@+#ffff0000/sibd-n$@+#ffe6ccff/avl-n$@+#ff0000ff/avg-n$@+#ffffff00/rip-n$@+#ff99cc99/rih-n$@+#ff99cc99/view/time=312/rX=-112.0/rY=-56.0/rZ=0.0/tX=-14.0/tY=18.0/scale=2.75/dim=0.25/browser/
Appearance of Tract Model,"The tract model represents the paths taken by groups of cells labeled by CND-1 and UNC-86 markers. Though traced from visible structures in membrane labeled images the tracts anticipate the topology of the network formed by neural outgrowth, e.g. the amphid commissue tract anticipates the ougrowth of cnd-1 positive cells through the the amphid comissure.",overlay,,,,,,,316,317,,,,
Outgrowth along Tract,The measured lengths of cell outgrowth from cells  individually labeled in different embryos are threaded through tracts. Temporal alignment is based on nuclear positions.,sprite,cell,,ABprppaaaaa ,,,,318,320,,,,
Multiple Cells Within a Tract,"To maximize the visibly of individual cell data in the same tract, neurites are drawn as 'pipes' routed through tracts in what are (for now at least) arbitrary relative positions. ",sprite,cell,,ABplpaaaaaa ,,,,357,358,,,,
Anterior End of Nerve Ring,"When spatially distinct groups of neurites within a single anatomical structure are visible, these are segmented as separate tracts and individual cells are assigned to the tract level structure they appear to run within.",overlay,,,,,,,349,355,,,,
Multicellular Structure,"When  single cell data is not available, outgrowth can be segmented and displayed that is reliably  assigned to a small set of cells that grow into the tract. The relative locations of cells within the structure remains unknown. ",sprite,cell,,ABprpappaaa,,,wormguides/models/obj_files/abstract_nerve_ring,352,553,,,,
